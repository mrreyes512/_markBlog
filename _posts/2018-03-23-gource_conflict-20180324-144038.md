Have you ever worked on a version controlled project and wanted to illustrate how much work you've put in over time? [Gource](http://gource.io/) is awesome for that!


----------------------------------

# Overview
Gource helps to illustrate a project's history using your **svn** or **git commit logs**. The visualization can be as simple as running the the project's root directory, or as complex as exporting multiple repo's to combine into one visualization. Below I'll illustrate both techniques.


----------------------------------

# Installation
For my installation I used Homebrew on my Mac:
```
$ brew install gource
```
If you're on a windows box, try to sell the machine and use the funds to get a mac. ;)


----------------------------------

# Simple Visualization
After installation:
Just change directory into a version controlled directory and execute:
```
~ $ cd my_awesome_app
~/my_awesome_app $ gource
```

Pretty awesome, right? But why stop at simple?


----------------------------------

# Gource In-Line Options
In it's default visualization, Gource looks nice, but if you have a large project, you may find that the filenames can get distracting, or you may want to highlight an individual user, or only show a filename up to a certain depth.. etc. Gource has plenty of options to make configuration nobs to make a really nice illustration. Lets check out some of the switches I used in my original video.


----------------------------------

# Complex Visualization
Look at some config files stuff
